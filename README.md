### EDA Melbourne Housing

This project demonstrates Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Melbourne Housing dataset using Julia and Pluto notebooks. The aim was to investigate trends in property prices, identify patterns, and create visualisations that communicate insights effectively.

**Key Features:**
- Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis, focusing on relevant variables such as price, suburb, rooms, distance, and property type.
- Conducted statistical summaries and visualisation to identify distributions, correlations, and outliers.
- Created geographic heatmaps showing above and below average priced properties.
- Fitted polynomial curves to reveal trends and relationships between variables.

**Technical Stack:**
- **Language:** Julia
- **Interactive Notebook:** Pluto Notebooks for live code execution and visualisation.
- **Data Visualisation Libraries:** Plots.jl, StatsPlots.jl for creating charts, heatmaps, and trend lines.

**Project Highlights:**
- Subsetted and transformed data to focus on key variables for plotting.
- Geographic heatmaps illustrate that higher priced properties cluster near the city center, while lower priced houses spread to outer suburbs.
- Polynomial curve fitting provides a clear trend of pricing patterns relative to variables like distance and room count.
- Interactive and reproducible workflow via Pluto notebooks.

This project serves as an introduction to real world EDA using Julia and highlights the importance of visualising data analysis.
